# Deep learning - Wine Quality challenge
# Description

This was a project during training time at BeCode.
We were provided with a wine dataset with contained data on red and white wines. The dataset of this assignment is a combination of a red wine and a white wine dataset. The combined dataset consists of 6497 wines, each with 11 features and a target value.

# Goal
* To use a deep learning library and train the neural network model to identify the good from bad wines.
* Tune the hyperperameters to imporve the performance of the neural network model.

# Installation

## Python version
* Python 3.9

## Packages used
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* tensorflow
* keras
* jupyter notebook
